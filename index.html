                <p>
                    Summer is officially here, which means the AC unit will be getting a lot of use. It’s important to keep the AC unit clean to keep it running efficiently and prevent the spread of germs. Here are a few tips on how to clean the AC unit:
                </p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        Vacuum the inside of the unit with a soft brush attachment. This will remove any dust or debris.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a damp cloth to wipe down the inside of the unit. Be sure to dry it completely afterward.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check the filters and replace them if they are dirty. Dirty filters can cause the AC unit to work harder and reduce its efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean the outside of the unit with a damp cloth. Be sure to dry it completely afterward.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have the unit serviced by a professional every few years. This will ensure that it is running properly and that all of the components are in good condition.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Following these tips will help to keep the AC unit clean and running efficiently. If you have any questions about AC unit maintenance, be sure to consult a professional.

                            Replace the Filter Every Three Months

                            Summertime is the perfect time to focus on maintaining your AC unit and prolonging its lifespan. One of the most important things you can do is replace the filter every three months. A dirty filter will decrease the unit’s efficiency and can cause it to break down prematurely. Be sure to keep the area around the AC unit clear of debris and plants, as they can block the airflow and reduce the unit’s effectiveness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, make sure the vents are not blocked by furniture or other objects. If you’re experiencing any problems with your AC unit, call a professional to inspect it and make any necessary repairs. Maintaining your AC unit is an important part of keeping your home cool and comfortable during the summer months. In Addition to replacing the filters, following these tips will help prolong the life of your AC unit.

                    Make sure the Vents are Clear and Unblocked
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Making sure your vents are clear and unblocked is important for several reasons. Not only does it help keep your home or office cooler in the summer, but it also prevents the accumulation of dust and other allergens. If you’re not sure whether your vents are clear, take a look at the airflow. If you can see light coming through the vents, then they’re most likely clear. You can also try holding a piece of paper up to the vent to see if it moves. If it does, then the vent is blocked and you’ll need to clear it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few different ways to do this, depending on what’s blocking the vent. If it’s just dust, you can use a vacuum cleaner or a duster to clean it out. If there’s something more substantial blocking the vent, like a piece of furniture, then you’ll need to move it out of the way. Once the vents are clear, make sure to keep them that way by regularly cleaning them out. This will help keep your home or office cooler in summer and also improve <a href="https://www.blownawayhvac.com/indoor-air-quality-mocksville/">air quality</a>.

                            Summertime is the perfect time to take advantage of the cool air provided by an AC unit. However, to ensure that the AC unit functions properly, it’s important to keep the surrounding area free of clutter and plants. One of the most common causes of AC unit failure is clogged filters. Clutter can block the airflow and prevent the filter from doing its job.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, leaves and other debris can get caught in the fan, causing the unit to work harder than necessary and eventually leading to failure. Plants can also be a problem for AC units. The moisture from plants can cause corrosion and damage to the unit. In addition, plants can block airflow and create a cooling obstruction. To keep your AC unit running smoothly, it’s important to keep the surrounding area free of clutter and plants.

                Get an Annual Maintenance Check from a Professional

            <p>
                Keeping your AC unit in good condition is important for prolonging its lifespan and ensuring efficient cooling during the hottest months of the year. By following a few simple maintenance tips, you can help keep your AC unit running smoothly all summer long. One of the most important things you can do to maintain your AC unit is to schedule an <a href="https://www.blownawayhvac.com/the-benefits-of-annual-air-conditioning-maintenance/">annual maintenance</a> check from a professional. During this check-up, the technician will clean and lubricate all of the moving parts, test the refrigerant levels, and inspect the wiring and electrical components.
            </p>
            <p>
                They may also recommend any necessary repairs or adjustments to help keep your AC unit running optimally. Another key factor in maintaining your AC unit is keeping it free of debris and leaves. Make sure to clear away any obstructions around the unit and periodically vacuum or sweep the area around it. You should also check your gutters and roof regularly to ensure that there is no build-up of leaves or other debris that could clog the air intake or drainage system on your AC unit.

                        Summer is the perfect time to take advantage of the warm weather and go outside and enjoy the sun. However, when it’s hot outside, your home can quickly become stuffy and uncomfortable. One way to cool down your <a href="https://www.blownawayhvac.com/reasons-to-consider-heat-pump-for-your-home/">home without breaking the bank is to turn off the AC when you’re not home or when it’s not needed</a>. If you’re going to be gone for a few hours, turning off the AC can save you a few bucks on your energy bill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if you’re home but don’t need the AC on, opening up the windows can help circulate some fresh air through your home. Just make sure to close the windows and turn on the AC before you come back inside, so your home doesn’t heat up again. So if you want to stay cool and save some money this summer, remember to turn off the AC when you’re not using it. Your wallet will thank you!
